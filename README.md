# SmartCart Customer Segmentation

## Overview
SmartCart Customer Segmentation is an unsupervised machine learning project designed to analyze customer data and group similar customers into meaningful clusters. The goal is to help businesses understand customer behavior and create personalized marketing strategies.

## Problem Statement
SmartCart collects large amounts of customer data including demographics, purchase history, and engagement metrics. Currently, the company uses generic marketing strategies for all customers, leading to inefficient campaigns and missed opportunities.

This project uses clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their behavior and characteristics.

## Dataset Features
The dataset contains customer information including:

### Demographics
- Year_Birth
- Education
- Marital_Status
- Income
- Kidhome
- Teenhome
- Dt_Customer

### Spending Behavior
- MntWines
- MntFruits
- MntMeatProducts
- MntFishProducts
- MntSweetProducts
- MntGoldProds

### Purchase Frequency
- NumDealsPurchases
- NumWebPurchases
- NumCatalogPurchases
- NumStorePurchases
- NumWebVisitsMonth

### Customer Feedback
- Recency
- Complain

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature scaling and transformation
3. Applying clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical, etc.)
4. Evaluating clusters
5. Visualizing customer segments
